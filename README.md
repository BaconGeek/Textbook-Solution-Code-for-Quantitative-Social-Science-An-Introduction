When I was a first-year master's student in economics (in 2018), I created this repo to share the solution code for end-of-chapter exercises of the textbook "Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction" by Professor Kosuke Imai.

When I was an undergraduate student, I was a core Stata user and had little experience in R (only a few hours in Econometrics class). This book's exercise　was largely helpful to get used to R.
